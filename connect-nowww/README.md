nowww

Redirects any domain with `www` to the same site without it.

  * `www.foobar3000.com` -> `foobar3000.com`
  * `www.helloworld3000.com` -> `helloworld3000.com`

  [no-www.org]: http://no-www.org

In short:

  All domains should have a `www` for backwards compatibility with what
early adopters of the internet have come to expect (and ctrl+enter adds it).
However, those domains should redirect to the root of the domain.

  * it means we type four fewer charaters
  * we don't type `http://` anymore, why would we type `www.`?
  * it's what the cool kids do (i.e. github)
  * `ftp`, `irc`, `ssh`, etc all have their own *protocols*. Why should the web also have a prefix?
